I believe AI is limiting job opportunities for citizens, everybody would choose robots over humans because they only require electricity and theyd have cheap repairs. To adapt to this enviorment i would work a job that requires alot of change in plans and a flexible schedule.

Right now as i am preparing for STAAR ive been feeling confident in my abillity to pass, Right now one of my main concerns is being consistent with my work. One thing i could do to help my stress is to take my mind off my work, re-think my mindset and solve. For the rest of the school year, i want to do my work, i know i could get it done, i just have to take the time. As for people i can talk to about things, i have a group of friends where we just talk about our problems and try to solve them.

Lastly the people making these kinda posts dont use logic, they just discuss whats on their minds.
